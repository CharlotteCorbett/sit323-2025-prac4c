## Calculator Microservice

This project is a microservice calculator that receives parameters via API calls then returns the result along with the HTTP status, via an Express server.

### How To Use This Microservice:
---
- All required libraries have been installed and are included.
- Number validation is included to prevent crashes caused by invalid input.
- API requests can be posted either using curl or Postman.
- API requests follow this format:
    http://localhost:port_number/service_name/?n1=value&n2=value

1. Start the service by opening a terminal session (it is assumed that you have already pulled this repo and opened it in your preferred IDE) and typing in `node app.js`. You should see the following message:
    
    "Hello, I'm listening to port 3040
    You can see my results on Postman or at http://localhost:3040"

2. Using Postman or Curl, lodge a HTTP GET request to the API in the following format: 
    http://localhost:port_number/service_name/?n1=value1&n2=value2

### Calculator Services:
---
- Logger (logger)
- Add (/add)
- Subtract (/subtract)
- Multiply (/multiply)
- Divide (/divide)
- Modulus (/modulo)
- Exponentiation (/exponentiate)
- Minimum (/minimum)
- Maximum (maximum)
- Random Number between a Given Range (/randomrange)
- Square Root (/squareroot)

### Logger (logger)
---

- Service that logs the result of each API call as well as the HTTP status of the request via the winston library in NodeJS.
- Runs on each request.
- Has no request methods.


### Add (/add)
---
Addition service that takes two parameters of numbers, adds them together, then returns the result along with the HTTP status.

Eg: HTTP GET http://localhost:3040/add/?n1=2&n2=2


### Subtract (/subtract)
---
Subtraction service that takes two parameters of numbers, subtracts them, then returns the result along with the HTTP status.

Eg: HTTP GET http://localhost:3040/subtract/?n1=2&n2=2

### Multiply (/multiply)
---
Multiplication service that takes two parameters of numbers, multiplies them, then returns the result along with the HTTP status.

Eg: HTTP GET http://localhost:3040/multiply/?n1=2&n2=2

### Divide (/divide)
---
Division service that takes two parameters of numbers, divides them, then returns the result along with the HTTP status.

Eg: HTTP GET http://localhost:3040/divide/?n1=2&n2=2

### Modulus (/modulo)
---
Modulus service that takes two parameters of numbers, performs a modulus operation, then returns the result along with the HTTP status.

Eg: HTTP GET http://localhost:3040/modulo/?n1=2&n2=2

### Exponentiation (/exponentiate)
---
Exponentiation service that takes two parameters of numbers, raises the first number (n1)to the power of the second number (n2), then returns the result along with the HTTP status.

Eg: HTTP GET http://localhost:3040/exponentiate/?n1=2&n2=2

### Minimum (/minimum)
---
Minimum service that takes two parameters of numbers, determines which number is the lowest, then returns the result along with the HTTP status.

Eg: HTTP GET http://localhost:3040/minimum/?n1=2&n2=2

### Maximum (maximum)
---
Minimum service that takes two parameters of numbers, determines which number is the highest, then returns the result along with the HTTP status.

Eg: HTTP GET http://localhost:3040/maximum/?n1=2&n2=2

### Random Number between a Given Range (/randomrange)
---
This service takes two parameters of numbers, generates a random number between the two numbers, then returns the result along with the HTTP status.

Eg: HTTP GET http://localhost:3040/randomrange/?n1=2&n2=2

### Square Root (/squareroot)
---
This service takes one parameter of a number, finds the square root of the number, then returns the result along with the HTTP status.

Eg: HTTP GET http://localhost:3040/squareroot/?n1=2
